	<h1>Response to mutation burden</h1>
	<p>Most mutations are deleterious, yet cancer cells and pathogenic bacteria are able to survive and thrive despite many mutations. To study what enables cells to survive a heavy mutation burden, we created a yeast model of mutation accumulation. We discovered that cells with different mutations mount a similar stress response and genes involved in this response are essential for survival.

	<h1>miRNAs and developmental robustness</h1>
	<p>One of the most amazing things about developmental biology is that a whole organism develops from a single cell. This process is remarkably consistent despite perturbations. While miRNAs are known to regulate gene expression, many have no known functions. We discovered that the miRNA machinery in the worm <i>C. elegans</i> acts in parallel with other developmental processes to ensure robust development and survival upon stresses such as starvation.
