	<h1>Response to mutation burden</h1>
	<p>Most mutations are deleterious, yet cancer cells and pathogenic bacteria are able to survive and thrive despite many mutations. To study what enables cells to survive a heavy mutation burden, we created a yeast model of mutation accumulation. We discovered that cells with different mutations mount a similar stress response and genes involved in this response are essential for survival. <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/515460v1">Read more on bioRxiv.</a></p>
